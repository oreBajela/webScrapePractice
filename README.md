Premier League Wins Analysis

Introduction

As a football enthusiast, this project aims to analyze the competitiveness of the Premier League by examining the number of wins across different teams.
The focus is on understanding whether certain teams have dominated the league over its 31-year history or if there is a more even distribution of wins 
among various clubs. Unfortunately, due to limitations in data extraction from the Premier League website, the analysis is narrowed down to evaluating
the competitiveness of the league for the 2023/24 season.

#Data Collection
The primary data source for this analysis is the Premier League website, specifically the page detailing club wins statistics: Premier League Wins Stats. 
Python's requests library is employed to fetch the HTML content of the webpage. The BeautifulSoup library is then used to parse the HTML, allowing access 
to specific tags and information.

#Data Storage: Extracted data, including club names and corresponding wins, are stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

#Software Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

#Installation: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install required Python libraries:

#Usage Open and run the Jupyter Notebook in the file section for detailed analysis and methodology.
